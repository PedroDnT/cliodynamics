# cliodynamics

<p>Imagine being able to analyze civilizations.
When I mean analyze, I don't mean a 30 page
dissertation by a college student, or a "connect
the dots" phase of your world history class.
I mean with a room full of computers and
you just waiting for the compiter to make
a model, a machine learning model. Well, using 
computers, especially machine learning to
analyze history. That is the definition of
cliodynamics.</p>
