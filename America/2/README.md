<h5 align="center">Detrending</h5>
<p>Detrending, a feature that allows you to deconstruct trends to get real data that allows you to get whether is data is going above or below the trend. This is useful when looking at metrics like birth rates, which decrease over time. In order to account for that, detrending is needed to counter that from affecting the model. This way, a better observation of American history through the perspective of data helps to really understand the highs and lows of American civilization.</p>
<h5 align="center">What am I missing?</h5>
<p>Currently, what I missing is political unity of the civlization. We will get a better picture of America if we look at with political unity involved. However, I encourage you to compare it to whenever America turns in on itself with riots, as well as when the biggest achievements of American civilization. Next time, I will include political unity in order to give a better picture of American history.</p>
