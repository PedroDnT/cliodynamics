<h5 align="center">Political Unity</h5>
<p>Political unity is one of the things that defines America today(February Fools! Sorry, I just wanted to create my own holiday. If you guys use it enough,
it could become official.). As we all know today, America is one of the many extremely polarized countries, and according to my model, there is more
polarization today than there was during the Civil War. The late 1910s were the era of the most polarization in US history(it may not be on the dot, but its
close).</p>
