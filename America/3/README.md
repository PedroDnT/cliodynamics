<h5 align="center">Political Unity</h5>
<p>Political unity is one of the things that defines America today(February Fools! Sorry, I just wanted to create my own holiday. If you guys use it enough,
it could become official...). As we all know today, America is one of many extremely polarized countries, and according to my model, there is more
polarization today than there was during the Civil War. The late 1910s were the era of the most polarization in US history(it may not be on the dot, but its
close). However, you could make the case that the low point in my model is around the time the race riots happened. Polarization has gone so far to lead to a coup as well as claims that the election results are false. While states haven't seceded yet, we see the declaration of independent countries in the borders of the country(in case you can't tell, I'm taling about the "Seattle secession" and a link about it is below). Anyway, here is how I came up with the graph. I started off with comparing the support from the electors, and I compared it to the popular vote in presidential elections from 1820 (fun fact, the 1820 election only had one candidate: James Monroe). I then continuously added the number for each consecutive year, and then I detrended it and got the numbers and the line (sorry, curve...), which then shows how united America is politically. The orange line generally tracks well with the best and worst of times in terms of political unity. The high in the 1980s to 90s shows tha peak of the Reagan era(so Reagan is a hero?) but it declines at the midterm of Senior Bush's presidency. From then, America gets more and more polarized, which makes sense once I considered the riot list at the end of this section(Original Data). Anyway, it is time to move on to another proxy, "Inverse Immigration".</p>

<h5 align="center">Inverse Immigration</h5>
<p>Immigration, a divisive issue that is on the minds of the minds of people in the West. Immigration is a solution to a problem(rapid aging crisis, people not having enough babies on average due mostly to heavy emphasis on work), but it is also a creator of problems(the riot link will give you more information, but whenever immigrants get involved, it never ends well). While we pride ourselves(for the most part) on being very accepting of immigrants, I would say that it could change. We are at around 14.6% foreign born, meaning that if you look at the past when foreign born population was around this same level, you saw the rise of anti-immigrant presidents like Woodrow Wilson(this general "rule" tracks with Trump). Immigration was high during the Civil War and the Gilded Age which were known as not the best time to be alive(I'm talking about the horrible working conditions). However, working conditions greatly improved, and a reflection of these improvements are seen in the Simpsons(there is no way you can be disrespected by almost all your colleagues and support a family of five today while barely working). Despite my rantings about how immigration can harm a society, I just want to say that immigration adds a spin on a country's culture, wchich can be seen through cuisine. However, I would watch out for for an anti-immigrant adgenda in the future, because its probably coming.

In case you are wondering how I made the graph with inverse immigration, I subtracted foreign born percent from 100 and scaled the data, and it fit the graph quite nicely.</p>
<h5 align="center">Family</h5>
<p>The family proxy, in case you were wondering, is the birth rates of America from 1821, but detrended. the reason I did this is because birth rates are constantly on the decline, and I wanted to show how birth rates are doing compared to the trend. I have two sets of detrended birth rates, with one being from 1821-1959, and the other one being from 1960-2022. Birth rates from 1821-1849 are estimates based on population statistics, and every non-decennial year is an estimate based off of linear growth(1890 is an estimate based on linear growth because 1890 census information was burned in a fire). Overall, the detrended birth rates declined from 1820 to 1860s, but then went up(it stayed nearly constant without detrending). The reason for this is probably the settlement of the Midwest via the Homestead Acts, which essentially gave free land to prospective settlers(it's not valid anymore in case you thought you don't have to pay for a house). It then keeps on decreasing from the end of the 1900s into the 1910s with the decrease ending at the peak of the Great Depression. There is a constant increase(for the most part) until 1960, which then is followed by a constant(for the most part) decrease. In the future, the family proxy probably won't go too far from zero as irth rates are already low, and I don't see a significant decrease anytime soon.</p>
