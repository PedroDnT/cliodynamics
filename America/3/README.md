<h5 align="center">Political Unity</h5>
<p>Political unity is one of the things that defines America today(February Fools! Sorry, I just wanted to create my own holiday. If you guys use it enough,
it could become official...). As we all know today, America is one of many extremely polarized countries, and according to my model, there is more
polarization today than there was during the Civil War. The late 1910s were the era of the most polarization in US history(it may not be on the dot, but its
close). However, you could make the case that the low point in my model is around the time the race riots happened. Polarization has gone so far to lead to a coup as well as claims that the election results are false. While states haven't seceded yet, we see the declaration of independent countries in the borders of the country(in case you can't tell, I'm taling about the "Seattle secession" and a link about it is below). Anyway, here is how I came up with the graph. I started off with comparing the support from the electors, and I compared it to the popular vote in presidential elections from 1820 (fun fact, the 1820 election only had one candidate: James Monroe). I then continuously added the number for each consecutive year, and then I detrended it and got the numbers and the line (sorry, curve...), which then shows how united America is politically. The orange line generally tracks well with the best and worst of times in terms of political unity. The high in the 1980s to 90s shows tha peak of the Reagan era(so Reagan is a hero?) but it declines at the midterm of Senior Bush's presidency. From then, America gets more and more polarized, which makes sense once I considered the riot list at the end of this section(Original Data). Anyway, it is time to move on to another proxy, "Inverse Immigration".</p>
