<h5 align="center">Immigration</h5>

<p>Immigration, a hotly conested issue in this country. But before diving into the data, I want you to remember what I said last time I did a prediction about
America's "future"(1970s onward was the future, just wanted to test my model). I said that immigration might be a stable cycle to work from when it comes to 
America's future. While I wasn't very clear then, I certainly have the graph now. As you can see on the graph, Immigration appears to be a somewhat stable
cycle to work off of. The cycle sees an increase in the first 50 years. Think about the time till Trump: there was very little backlash against immigration
for the most part and the people who were against it didn't hold the majority of power. There might've been some isolated times where there might've been 
anti-immigrant backlash(like 9-11), but the factions against immigration didn't hold much power in the government, at least until Trump(I am only talking
about the 21st century so far). That's where we are. However, its been a little over 50 years, and by the cycle, there should've been a civil war. Or maybe the
civil war was going to happen but then COVID came and united everyone(that sounds so crazy). However, when looking beyond a civil war and its underlying
characteristics, one thing that appeared in common was the mass polarization. So, maybe the civil war was a digital warfare campaign on social media(who knows
how wars are fought these days). Anyway, based of this seemingly stable cycle, we can infer that we are where America was at the start of the 1870s. That means
we are in the Gilded Age, an era of industrialization, isolationism, and reduced military spending(and hopefully a budget surplus this time). If I were to tell 
you more about what else I think is going to happen, I would say that quality of life would say that there would be some mild anti-immigration laws that don't 
keep too many foreigners out, but they're also not too liberal with immigration. Also, I would say that a new form of economic organization would come through.
It could be more of an online economy, or maybe it could be a new revitalization of American industry. Now, I am sure that some of you are looking for the 
"prophet of doom" predictions(to be real though, no prophet of doom really writes paragraphs on his programming work). One prediction that might spell "doom"
(it may not be too bad, for some) is a new economic depression. If we are in a parallel version of the 1870s(because history repeats), then there would probably
be a recession that could be as bad as 2008. This could be a move to stabilize the currency, and with that the economy. The main problem in the 1870s were the
railroads as many were speculating in them to gain a market share. Even though the time to search for market share is over(most companies want profit NOW), I doubt
this is the case. However, one commonality is that the money supply to take out loans could be declining. As more Baby Boomers retire, there will be less money
that will be able to be loaned out, and so that could be where the crisis starts. An economic crisis does start with the contraction of the money supply, but 
that is also because the economy is so messed up that the only thing keeping it going are the infusions of cash. This is what could be happening, as the Baby
Boomers are a large generation, and as they retire, the smaller "saver" generation may not collectively save as much money as the Boomers did in order to 
keep the economy afloat. Who knows, we might see the "Panic of 2025" The economy is a place with investment abound, but without the money to support them, it
gets harder to keep our modern economy going. Like one railroad company started the Panic in 1873, a large tech company(maybe Apple?) could start the "Panic of
2025". Or maybe we are in the Panic of 1873 right now(it lasted for around 20 years by the way). But whatever we will face, I can tell you that we will come out
of this strong, like how America's navy came out of the 1890s as a rising star, eventually giving the Spanish a beating on Cuba and the Philippines(we do the same
to China maybe?).</p>
